        We built this Facebook app to support Smirnoff's Nightlife Exchange Project, allowing users to vote for their town to receive a massive Smirnoff party. The twist was that for every person they got to vote as well, they earned a countervote, which could be used to vote down opposing&nbsp;towns.
