        Agency Republic<br>
        Agency Website<br>
    </h2>

    <p id="intro_addendum">
        I remember when I first joined Republic, I was drafted in to help on the new agency website. 3 years and 2 complete restarts later, we actually built it! The main lesson was how hard it is to get anything done on internal projects. However, the site we made was fantastic. I worked primarily on the frontend styles and CMS templates, with another dev working on the backend stuff.
        <br><br>
        Sadly (since AR's merger with Critical Mass) the site has come down, so these screenshots and the article linked below are the only remaining vestiges of that piece of work.
