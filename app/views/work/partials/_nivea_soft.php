        Soft<br>

        This small site was part of a campaign for the Nivea Soft range. Nicola de Main had done the illustrations for the pots, and her fashion advice was dispensed through magazine style mood boards on the site. I was the sole dev on the project. 
        <br><br>
        The campaign is long done, but the site still exists in a little nook of Nivea's servers.
