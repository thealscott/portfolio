			I've been working as a <strong>developer</strong> in digital advertising for more or less <strong>4 years</strong>, and in that time I have been involved in making a load of stuff! The Big Red Button below will take you to see some of the most interesting bits of that stuff.

			Having studied a tenuously relevant interactive media course at <strong>Bournemouth University</strong>, I was lucky enough to be taken on at <strong>Agency Republic</strong> after I graduated.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since then I've worked with some supremely talented and fascinating people (many of whom are now my friends), and had the chance to build things for a dizzying array of massive brands.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now I'm a pretty decent developer (even if I do say so myself). I'd describe myself as a <strong>full-stack dev</strong> that leans a little to the front-end side. I've worked on small builds as a solo dev as well as on larger builds with a team in both dedicated <strong>front-end</strong> and <strong>back-end</strong> roles.
